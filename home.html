    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Most electronic music softwares have an extremely steep learning curve, 
          making it difficult for new producers to gain experience producing. 
          GarageBand is geared towards beginners with its use of extensive libraries, 
          graphical descriptions, and simplified editing tools, catching new producers 
          up to speed before jumping into more studio-level software.

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Have you ever used a music producing software before today?</li>

          <li>Talk to me about your musical background, whether it is electronic 
            or not. How long have you been involved with music, or have had any 
            interest in music, or listened to music, and what kind of 
            experiences do you have in those respects?</li>

          <li>(for those who have used it before) What have you used GarageBand for?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="qcat" id="navigation">
        <h4>Lightly-Guided Navigation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being easiest and 10 being most difficult, 
            how would you rate the navigation for instruments?</li>

          <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being easiest and 10 being most difficult,
            how would you rate the means of adding instrument tracks into the project?</li>

          <li> Could you please input some notes into a track for me?</li>

          <li> Could you try to make changes to some of the notes you already recorded?</li>

          <li> Can you try to add a looping music segment onto the track? </li>

          <li>Can you change the key and tempo of the project?</li>

          <li>Clarifying automation, it is a technique in electronic music 
            production where you essentially program the computer to make changes 
            to your track as you play music. On most music softwares, this is a 
            graphical process, so there's no code or anything like that involved.
            With this knowledge, can you try to find automation settings and 
            add some on this track? </li>

          <li>What is one part of this interface that made your life easier or harder? 
            Talk about that with me.</li>

          <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your comfort with this software?</li>

          <li>(for those who indicated less music experience) How would you rate your 
            ability to adapt to this interface from 1 to 10, 1 being no way and 10 being 
            it feels natural? In other words, if I asked you to create a song using this, 
            how comfortable or uncomfortable would you feel with that task?</li>

          <li>(for those who indicated GarageBand experience) How would you feel 
            this software has or may have prepared you for more advanced music 
            production software?</li>

          <li>What is something you felt was unclear as you were navigating this 
            interface, and why?</li>
          
          <li>What is something all beginner producers should know that may or may 
            not be accessible on GarageBand?</li>
          
          <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no way and 10 being with ease, 
            how would you rate your ability to develop a fully-fleshed out vision 
            of a project on Garageband?</li>

    <h3>Responses</h3>
    <div class="userrow">
      <div class="useritem">
        <h4>Anonymous User 1</h4>
        <div class="summrow">
          <p>Summary: User A is inexperienced with both music and music production. They 
            made extensive use of the quick help, which they praised for pointing 
            directly to anything being hovered over. They  tended to search more for 
            buttons to navigate libraries rather than scroll bars. They had a hard 
            time finding the display and means to change tempo and key. Metronome 
            controls were simple because there were moving parts on the button. Opening 
            tracks was very intuitive to them but things requiring clicking were not.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
          <p>MAIN TAKEAWAY: Buttons are very beginner-friendly, especially if labelled 
            with clear icons.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="useritem">
        <h4>Anonymous User 2</h4>
        <div class="summrow">
          <p>Summary: User B is inexperienced with digital music but heavily knowledgeable 
            with music creation and performance. They showed heavy frustration with navigating 
            menus, particularly those not on the interface itself but on the top bar menu - 
            these were seen as less important to the function of the interface. They had difficulty 
            locating key and tempo information. They managed to do well despite not using the quick 
            help as much.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
          <p>MAIN TAKEAWAY: Functions relegated to the top bar of the interface appear to be more 
            administrative tasks, and thus less relevant to what is on the interface.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="useritem">
        <h4>Anonymous User 3</h4>
        <div class="summrow">
          <p>Summary: User C is heavily experienced with both music performance and production. 
            Navigating the various libraries was relatively simple for them. However, they had initially 
            struggled with the interface for recording notes and being able to find musical typing. They 
            felt that the interface was captivating enough to want to stay on it “for hours on end, 
            until very late at night.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
          <p>MAIN TAKEAWAY: Crucial tools, such as musical typing, should be displayed more prominently 
            on the interface.</p>

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Personas are essential in the realm of software development because they allow designers to
        empathize with the users of their end product by creating people and crafting their stories,
        and thinking about designs that would leave these personas satisfied. For GarageBand, I crafted 
        two distinct personas.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="persona">
      <div class="sage">
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="describe">
            <h4>Sage West (22, she/they) </h4>
            <p><i>
              Sage was going through their computer when they found this app pre-installed on their laptop. 
              Despite having minimal experience with music or music production, this app looked kinda cool so 
              she decided to mess around and see what she could make.
            </i>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              This persona represents a flighty intellectually-curious user, who stumbles upon Garageband and 
              starts using it due to sheer curiosity.  The persona exists as a stand-in for a user who has very 
              minimal experience with music as a whole but is pushed into their passion via this resource. They 
              will struggle with the various menus in the app and will be easily frustrated by tasks deemed too 
              difficult.

              Martin has been writing sheet music for ages, but has decided he wants to “get with the kids” as 
              they say and try out electronic production. He’s looking for good ways to translate his analog music 
              experience into a digital music ability.

              This persona represents users who want to take their already-existing music experience a step further. 
              This particular user is not the most technologically-savvy, and will take time out of their day to work 
              through the software so it doesn’t interrupt flows of ideas when actually working on pieces.
